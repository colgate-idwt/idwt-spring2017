# Study Guide For Final Exam

The final exam is **Monday, May 8th 3:00pm-5:00pm**.  The exam covers material from homeworks 3 (machine learning) and the more recent readings on Google Flu Trends, Data and Goliath, and Weapons of Math Destruction.  Material that was covered by the midterm exam will *not* be repeated on the final.

Format: some technical questions (similar to HW 3) followed by an essay question (see below).  The exam is **closed book** except that you may bring one double-sided page of "crib notes."  Please **turn this in with your exam.**

Study tips:

- Review the homework.  
- Review the lecture notes.  The relevant technical lectures are Lectures 14-19.
- Revisit the readings associated with these lectures.
- Prepare notes for each of the essay questions below.
- Feel free to post questions on piazza.


## Essay Questions

The final exam will include one essay question.  Candidate essay questions are below.  During the exam you will be randomly assigned to one of the essay questions.  Each question is closely tied to one (or more) of the readings.

A strong essay will have the following characteristics (the three S's):

- *Succinct*.  Given that you are being asked to complete this in an exam setting, I am expecting a short response (say, 2 pages) and I am not expecting elegant prose but rather looking for a clear and concise summary.
- *Structured*.  You are strongly encouraged to "signpost" the structure of your argument.  For example you are encouraged to write things like "The first characteristic of a WMD is ...," and then later "The second characteristic is...", etc.
- *Specific*.  Reference specific, concrete examples from the relevant readings.  For example, saying that surveillance by business is "creepy" or "invasive of privacy" is the kind of generic statement you could say without taking this class. On the other hand, the reading *Terms of Service* offers highly specific concerns raised by the experts in this area (Peppet, Ohm, boyd, etc.) that were interviewed for that article.


Essay questions:

1. **GFT.**  First, briefly explain how Google Flu Trends (GFT) embodies many of the characteristics of "big data" that were described in course readings.  Then conduct a post-mortem analysis of GFT, analyzing why it failed.  Your analysis should make connections to (at least some) of the big data characteristics described in the first part.
2. **Surveillance and data analysis.**  Surveillance requires not only collecting data but actually doing something with the data that is collected.  How have technological advances changed the nature of surveillance?  Your answer should consider not only the *collection* of data but also its *analysis*.  Where possible, try to contrast what capabilities the technology offers that were difficult or impossible without the technology.
3. **Government institutions and big data.**  First, briefly describe *one* example where a government insitution (NSA, judicial system, law enforcement, etc.) uses big data technology to collect data about individuals and/or use data in important decision-making processes.  Discuss the societal implications of this use of big data technologies.  Identify *three* distinct and specific benefits or risks that were described in the readings. 
4. **Corporate institutions and big data.**  First, briefly describe *one* example where an industry or specific corporation (tech industry, Google, Facebook, banking industry, ZestFinance, etc.) uses big data technology to collect data about individuals and/or use data in important decision-making processes.  Discuss the societal implications of this use of big data technologies.  Identify *three* distinct and specific benefits or risks that were described in the readings.
5. **WMDs.**  From O'Neil's perspective, what is a WMD?  Describe its essential characteristics.  For each characteristic, give an example of a WMD and why this characteristic is significant.  Where possible, connect O'Neil's book with other readings from the class.

Good luck!
