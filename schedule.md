    + In the next two weeks, I want to dive into some technical questions.  The first question is the following: *How do we process big data efficiently?*  We will look at some basic tasks, such as finding rows in a table, joining two tables together.  We will see that we can use more fundamental operations -- binary search and sorting -- to solve these tasks.
- **Wed, Mar 1 Lecture 10: Algorithms for search and sort**
    + Reading:
        * Ch. 3 of Algorithms Unlocked, by Thomas Cormen.  Available [online through the Colgate library](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/colgate/detail.action?docID=10672795).

## Week 7

        * Review last week's reading.
        * Ch. 1 and 2 of *Nine algorithms that changed the future: the ingenious ideas that drive today's computers*, by John MacCormick.  Available [online through the Colgate library catalog](http://library.colgate.edu/).

    + In this lecture, I want to explore a second question: *How do we link disparate data sources?*  Unlike a join, the challenge here is that the data sources that we want to join are not connected by key/foreign key relationships.  This problem comes up in the Big Data world quite often -- several examples were given in Ch. 6 of BD (specifically the Recombinant Data section).  The readings for this lecture provide some other examples.

- **Friday, Mar 10:** [Reading Engagement Exercise #4](hw/reading_engagement_4.pdf) is due.  Submit your essay via gradescope.

Your goal: (a) understand at a high level how GFT works, (b) find connections between the methodology used to build GFT and the machine learning reading you did in DSB.
        * [The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis](http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf) An article in Science critiquing GFT.  Please read this closely.  
    + Questions to guide your reading: Please come to class with answers to these questions:
        1. The researchers ultimately frame the problem of detecting flu outbreaks as a specific data mining task.  What kind of task is it framed as? Choose among the tasks from DSB which include classification, regression, similarity matching, clustering, co-occurrence grouping, profiling, link prediction, data reduction, causal modeling.
        2. In your own words, what is the input to the task? Be as precise as possible (you could even draw a little table of training data).
        3. How did the researchers determine which search terms were flu-related? Briefly describe the process (2-3 sentences).
        4. Identify an example of a *holdout* data set. For what purpose was the holdout set used?
        5. Identify an example of a *validation* data set. For what purpose was the validation set used?
        6. The second article identifies two high-level issues that factored into GFT’s problems. What are they?
        7. The second article identifies two high-level issues that factored into GFT’s problems. What are they?
        8. Some have claimed that GFT's errors were due media-stoked panic about the flu. The authors challenge this claim. What is their evidence for doing so?
        9. The authors offer an alternative explanation for GFT's errors. What is it?

## Week 15

- Monday, May 08 **Final Exam** 3:00pm-5:00pm.

The final exam will include essay questions.  Candidate essay questions will be posted by the last day of classes.  During the exam you will be randomly assigned to one of the essay questoins.  To help guide your reading in the last few weeks, here are some *potential* essay questions.  

1. First, briefly explain how Google Flu Trends (GFT) embodies many of the characteristics of "big data" that were described in course readings.  Then conduct a post-mortem analysis of GFT, analyzing why it failed.  Your analysis should make connections to (at least some) of the big data characteristics described in the first part.
2. Surveillance requires not only collecting data but actually doing something with the data that is collected.  How have technological advances changed the nature of surveillance?  Your answer should consider both the collection and analysis of data.
3. Surveillance by government.  First, briefly describe at least two ways the U.S. Government surveils.  Then discuss the societal implications of those surveillance activities, identifying three distinct benefits or risks.
4. Surveillance by business.  First, briefly describe at least two ways businesses surveil.  Then discuss the societal implications of those surveillance activities, identifying three distinct benefits or risks.
